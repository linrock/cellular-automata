        <h1>Cellular automata</h1>
        <p>
          Cellular automata are grids of "cells" where each cell
          changes over time based on the state of its neighbors.
        </p>

        <h3>Elementary cellular automata</h3>
        <p>
          The simplest automata are one-dimensional rows. Each cell has
          two possible states. The state of a cell in the next generation
          depends only on its current state and the state of its two
          neighbors.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can visualize the evolution of a one-dimensional automata
          over time by adding new generations to the top or bottom of a
          grid. We'll then see a pattern that appears to scroll vertically.

        <h3>Conway's Game of Life</h3>
        <p>
          The most popular two-dimensional cellular automaton was created
          by John Conway in 1970. In each new generation, the state of the
          world is generated based on these rules:
          <ul>
            <li>A dead cell with three neighbors becomes a live cell</li>
            <li>A live cell with two or three neighbors stays alive</li>
            <li>All other live cells become dead cells</li>
          </ul>

        <p>
          The bottom half of the world is an elementary cellular automaton.
          The top half is governed by the rules of Life.

        <h3>2x elementary automata + Game of Life</h3>
        <p>
          The top and bottom thirds of the world are two different
          elementary cellular automata. The middle third of the world
          follows the rules of Life.
