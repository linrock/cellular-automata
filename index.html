          A cellular automaton is a grid of cells where each cell changes
          over time based on a set of rules and the state of its neighbors.
          Simple rules can lead to complex patterns.

          The world is a 1D row of cells. In each new generation of
          the world, the state of a cell changes based on its current
          state and the states of its neighbors.
        <p>
        <p>
          We can visualize the evolution of 1D cellular automata
          over time by adding new generations to the top or bottom of a
          grid. If we do this continuously over time, we'll see a pattern
          scrolling vertically.

        <p>
          The simplest automata are known as elementary cellular automata
          (ECA). Each cell has 2 possible states: 0 or 1. The state of each
          cell in the next generation depends only on 3 values: its current
          state and the state of its two immediate neighbors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since there are 2<sup>3</sup> = 8 orientations of the 3 values,
          and there are 2 possible states for a cell, there are 2<sup>8</sup>
          = 256 rules for determining the new state of a cell in the next
          generation of the world.
        </p>

        <div class="flex-responsive">
          <p>
            One way to view the behavior of a rule is to initialize the
            first generation with a single 1 in the middle. Some rules such as
            rule 30 will lead to chaotic and aperiodic patterns.

            Other rules such as rule 90 will lead to symmetric and periodic patterns.
            When starting with one cell, a fractal pattern called a Sierpinkski
            triangle is generated.

            Rules may behave differently when cells are initialized with random
            cells. Rule 106 starting with a single cell leads to only a diagonal
            line. However, starting cells with random states leads to chaotic behavior.

          The world is a 2D grid of cells. In each new generation, the state
          of a cell may change based on its current state and the states of
          its surrounding neighbors.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can visualize the evoluation of 2D cellular automata over time
          by updating the states of the cells on the 2D grid with the new cell
          states from each new generation.

            Created by mathematician John Conway in 1970, this is perhaps
            the most well-known cellular automata. Cells have two possible
            states: live or dead. New generations of the world consider only
            the 8 immediate neighbors of each cell.

          Cellular automata are considered Life-like if they're 2D, cells have
          2 possible states, and change based on their 8 immediate neighbors.
          The rules by which cell states change may differ.
          A common notation for rules is written as Bx/Sy, where:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>B = Birth - dead cells with these numbers of neighbors become live</li>
          <li>S = Survival - live cells with these numbers of neighbors stay live</li>
          <li>x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 8

              These are multi-state systems where the state of a cell changes
              if enough neighboring cells are in a state that win over it.
              Systems with 3 states are also known as "Rock, paper, scissors".
              For example, if a scissors cell is surrounded by enough rock
              cells, then the scissors cell becomes a rock in the next
              generation.
