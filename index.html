        <h1>Cellular automata</h1>
        <p>
          A cellular automaton is a grid of cells where each cell changes
          over time based on a set of rules and the state of its neighbors.
          The state of a grid in the next point in time is called a
          generation. Simple rules can lead to complex patterns.

        <p>
          The world is a 1D row of cells. Each new generation considers
          the state of a cell along with the states of its neighbors to
          its left and right.
        <p>
        <p>
          We can visualize the evolution of 1D cellular automata
          over time by adding new generations to the top or bottom of a
          grid. If we do this continously over time, we'll see a pattern
          scrolling vertically.

        <p>
          The simplest automata are known as elementary cellular automata
          (ECA). Each cell has two possible states. The state of a cell in
          the next generation depends on its current state and the state of
          its two immediate neighbors on its left and right.

        <p>
          The world is a 2D grid of cells. Each generation considers the
          states of each cell along with the states of the cell's surrounding
          neighbors on the grid.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can visualize new generations of 2D cellular automata over time
          by updating the states of the cells on the 2D grid itself.

          Cells have two possible states: live or dead. New generations of
          the world consider only the 8 immediate neighbors of each cell.
          In each generation, the state of the world is generated based on
          these rules:
          <ul>
            <li>A dead cell with 3 neighbors becomes a live cell</li>
            <li>A live cell with 2 or 3 neighbors stays the same</li>
            <li>All other live cells become dead cells</li>
          </ul>

        <p>
          In the Game of Life, if we instead fade a cell from live to
          dead over a few generations, moving patterns in the world will
          appear to leave trails behind them.

        <p>
          The bottom half of the world is an elementary cellular automaton.
          As each generation reaches the middle, it influences the top half
          of the world, which is governed by the Game of Life.

          elementary cellular automata. The middle third of the world
          follows the Game of Life.
