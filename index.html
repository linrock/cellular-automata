        <h1>Cellular automata</h1>
        <p>
          Cellular automata are grids of cells where each cell changes
          over time based on a set of rules and the state of its neighbors.
          The state of a grid in the next point in time is called a
          generation. Simple rules can lead to complex patterns.

        <h3 id="one-dimensional">Elementary cellular automata</h3>
        <p>
          The simplest automata are one-dimensional rows. Each cell in a
          row has two possible states. The state of a cell in the next
          generation depends only on its current state and the state of
          its two neighbors to its left and right.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can visualize the evolution of one-dimensional automata
          over time by adding new generations to the top or bottom of a
          grid. If we do this continously, we'll see a pattern that
          appears to scroll vertically.

        <h3 id="two-dimensional">Two-dimensional cellular automata</h3>
        <p>
          The world is a 2D grid of cells. Each generation considers the
          states of a cell along with the states of its neighbors
          in two dimensions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most popular two-dimensional cellular automaton is John
          Conway's Game of Life. Cells have two possible states: live or
          dead. In each generation, the state of the world is generated
          based on these rules:
          <ul>
            <li>A dead cell with 3 neighbors becomes a live cell</li>
            <li>A live cell with 2 or 3 neighbors stays the same</li>
            <li>All other live cells become dead cells</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>Trails in 2D</h3>
        <p>
          In the Game of Life, if we instead fade a cell from live to
          dead over a few generations, moving patterns in the world will
          appear to leave trails behind them.

        <h3>Elementary automaton + Game of Life</h3>
        <p>
          The bottom half of the world is an elementary cellular automaton.
          As each generation reaches the middle, it influences the top half
          of the world, which is governed by the Game of Life.

        <h3>2x elementary automata + Game of Life</h3>
        <p>
          The top and bottom thirds of the world are two different
          elementary cellular automata. The middle third of the world
          follows the Game of Life.
