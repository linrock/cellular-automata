            A cellular automaton is a grid of cells where each cell changes
            over time based on a set of rules and the states of its neighbors.
            Simple rules can lead to complex patterns and behaviors.

            The world is a 1D row of cells. We can see the evolution of the world
            over time by adding new generations to the top or bottom of a grid.
            If we do this repeatedly, we'll see a pattern scrolling vertically.

          <h3 id="elementary-cellular-automata">Elementary cellular automata</h3>
          <p>
            The simplest automata are known as elementary cellular automata
            (ECA). Each cell has 2 possible states: 0 or 1. The state of each
            cell in the next generation depends only on 3 values: its current
            state and the state of its two immediate neighbors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since there are 2<sup>3</sup> = 8 orientations of the 3 values,
            and there are 2 possible states for a cell, there are 2<sup>8</sup>
            = 256 rules for determining the new state of a cell in the next
            generation of the world.
          </p>

          <div class="flex-responsive">
            <p>
              One way to view the behavior of a rule is to initialize the
              first generation with a single 1 in the middle. Some rules such as
              rule 30 will lead to chaotic and aperiodic patterns.
            </p>

              Other rules such as rule 90 will lead to symmetric and periodic
              patterns. When starting with one middle cell, a fractal pattern
              called a Sierpinkski triangle appears.

              Rules may behave differently when cells are initialized with
              random states. Rule 106 starting with a single cell leads to only
              a diagonal line. However, initial cells with random states
              leads to chaotic behavior.

            The world is a 2D grid of cells. We can see how it changes over

            Glider guns are oscillators that continuously generate gliders.
            Gliders travel across space at a constant speed and can be used
            to transmit information. Many glider guns can be arranged together

            Cellular automata are considered Life-like if they're similar to
            the Game of Life: 2D, cells have 2 possible states and change based
            on their 8 immediate neighbors. A common notation for the rules by
            which cells change is a string in the format of
            <strong>Bx/Sy</strong>, where:

                These are multi-state systems where the state of a cell changes
                if enough neighboring cells are in a state that win over it.
                Systems with 3 states are also known as "Rock, paper, scissors".
                For example, if a scissors cell is surrounded by enough rock

                The bottom half of the world is a chaotic elementary cellular
                automaton. The top half of the world starts off empty and is
                the Game of Life with 2D trails.
              </p>
              <p>
                As each generation of the ECA reaches the middle, it provides
                live cells to the top half of the world, which then starts
                spawning new life.

                The top of and bottom of the world are generated with 2 different
                ECAs. The middle of the world follows the rules of the Game of Life.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since the top ECA generates symmetric patterns, it starts off
                also creating symmetric patterns in the middle. The bottom ECA
                generates chaotic patterns. As the two colors collide, they form a
                third color.
